Here we play with Python code and math.


## Code and math

```python
import json
import openai

# replace with your path 
PATH_TO_SCRT_JSON = '<path_to_open_ai_key>.json'

with open(PATH_TO_SCRT_JSON) as f:
    openai.api_key = json.load(f)['key']
```

$$ \frac{1}{\pi}=\frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{99^{2}} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(4 k) !}{k !^{4}} \frac{26390 k+1103}{396^{4 k}} $$
