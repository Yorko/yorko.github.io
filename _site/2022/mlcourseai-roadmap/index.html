				<p><a href="https://mlcourse.ai">mlcourse.ai</a> is an open Machine Learning course by OpenDataScience (<a href="https://ods.ai">ods.ai</a>, led by me. In 2017-2019, I’ve been leading active session of the course, offering essential theoretical ground and a ton of practice (assignments, Kaggle Inclass competitions, projects, etc.). All for free. Some 26k people participated, ~1500 finished the course, I got dozens of direct messages on how passing the course changed careers of <a href="https://mlcourse.ai">mlcourse.ai</a>  alumni. Right now, the course in a self-paced mode, still has much to offer.</p>

<hr />

<p>This roadmap guides you through self-paced <a href="https://mlcourse.ai/">mlcourse.ai</a>. You can now pass the course as an <a href="https://ods.ai/tracks/mlcourse_ai">ODS.ai track</a> as well.</p>

<p>If you prefer a video version, there it is:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPlYV_DryEo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>First, take a look at <a href="prerequisites">course prerequisites</a>. Be ready to spend around 3 months on passing the course, some 4-10 hours/week. Though it heavily depends on how much you will be willing to dive into Kaggle competitions (they are time-consuming but very rewarding in terms of skills) that we offer during this course. To get help, <a href="https://mlcourse.ai/contacts">join OpenDataScience</a>, discussions are held in the #mlcourse_ai Slack channel. For a general picture on what role all of Machine Learning plays in your would-be Data Science career, check the “Jump into Data Science” <a href="https://youtu.be/FGuGg9F2VUs">video</a>, it walks you through the preparation process for your first DS position once basic ML and Python are covered (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/festline/how-to-jump-into-data-science">slides</a>). In case you are already in DS, this course will be a good ML refresher.</p>

<p>Below we outline the 10 topics covered in the course, and give specific instructions on articles to read, lectures to watch, and assignments to crack. You can purchase a Bonus Assignments pack with the best non-demo versions of <a href="https://mlcourse.ai/">mlcourse.ai</a> assignments. Select the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ods_mlcourse">“Bonus Assignments” tier</a> on Patreon or a <a href="https://boosty.to/ods_mlcourse/purchase/1142055?ssource=DIRECT&amp;share=subscription_link">similar tier</a> on Boosty (rus).</p>

  <summary>Details of the deal</summary>

mlcourse.ai is still in self-paced mode but we offer you Bonus Assignments with solutions for a contribution of $17/month. The idea is that you pay for ~1-5 months while studying the course materials, but a single contribution is still fine and opens your access to the bonus pack.

Note: the first payment is charged at the moment of joining the Tier Patreon, and the next payment is charged on the 1st day of the next month, thus it's better to purchase the pack in the 1st half of the month.

mlcourse.ai is never supposed to go fully monetized (it's created in the wonderful open ODS.ai community and will remain open and free) but it'd help to cover some operational costs, and Yury also put in quite some effort into assembling all the best assignments into one pack. Please note that unlike the rest of the course content, Bonus Assignments are copyrighted. Informally, Yury's fine if you share the pack with 2-3 friends but public sharing of the Bonus Assignments pack is prohibited.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic1-teaser.jpg" /></div>

<p>You definitely want to immediately start with Machine Learning and see math in action. But 70-80% of the time working on a real project is fussing with data, and here Pandas is very good, I use it in my work almost every day. This article describes the basic Pandas methods for preliminary data analysis. Then we analyze the data set on the churn of telecom customers and try to predict the churn without any training, simply relying on common sense. By no means should you underestimate such an approach.</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic2-teaser.jpg" /></div>

<p>The role of visual data analysis is hard to overestimate, this is how new insights are found in data and how features are engineered. Here we discuss main data visualization techniques and how they are applied in practice. Also take a sneak peek into multidimensional feature space using the t-SNE algorithm, which sometimes is useful but mostly just draws such Christmas tree decorations.</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic3-teaser.png" /></div>

<p>Here we delve into machine learning and discuss two simple approaches to solving the classification problem. In a real project, you’d better start with something simple, and often you’d try out decision trees or nearest neighbors (as well as linear models, the next topic) right after even simpler heuristics. We discuss the pros and cons of trees and nearest neighbors. Also, we touch upon the important topic of assessing the quality of model predictions and performing cross-validation. The article is long, but decision trees, in particular, deserve it – they make a foundation for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, two algorithms that you’ll be likely using in practice most often.</p>

<h4 id="week-4-linear-classification-and-regression">Week 4. Linear Classification and Regression</h4>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic4-teaser.png" /></div>

<p>The following 5 articles may form a small brochure, and that’s for a good reason: linear models are the most widely used family of predictive algorithms. These articles represent our course in a miniature: a lot of theory, a lot of practice. We discuss the theoretical basis of the Ordinary Least Squares method and logistic regression, as well as their merits in terms of practical applications. Also, crucial concepts like regularization and learning curves are introduced. In the practical part, we apply logistic regression to the <a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2">task</a> of user identification on the Internet, it’s a Kaggle Inclass competition (a.k.a “Alice”, we go on with this competition in Week 6).</p>

<p><em>It’s better to admit that this week’s material would rather take you 2-3 weeks to digest and practice, that’s fine. But for consistency with article numbering, we stick to “Week 4” for this topic.</em></p>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic5-teaser.png" /></div>

<p>Yet again, both theory and practice are exciting. We discuss why “wisdom of a crowd” works for machine learning models, and an ensemble of several models works better than each one of the ensemble members. In practice, we try out Random Forest (an ensemble of many decision trees) – a “default algorithm” in many tasks. We discuss in detail the numerous advantages of the Random Forest algorithm and its applications. No silver bullet though: in some cases, linear models still work better and faster.</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic6-teaser.png" /></div>

<p>Feature engineering is one of the most interesting processes in the whole of ML. It’s an art or at least craft and is therefore not yet well-automated. The article describes the ways of working with heterogeneous features in various ML tasks with texts, images, geodata, etc. Practice with the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2">“Alice” competition</a> is going to convince you how powerful feature engineering can be.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic7-teaser.jpg" /></div>

<p>Here we turn to the vast topic of unsupervised learning, it’s about the cases when we have data but it is unlabeled, no target feature to predict like in classification/regression tasks. Most of the data out there is unlabeled, and we need to be able to make use of it. We discuss only 2 types of unsupervised learning tasks – clustering and dimensionality reduction.</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic8-teaser.png" /></div>

<p>The theoretical part here covert the analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent, it was this optimization method that made it possible to successfully train both neural networks and linear models on really large training sets. Here we also discuss what can be done in cases of millions of features in a supervised learning task (“hashing trick”) and move on to Vowpal Wabbit, a utility which allows you to train a model with gigabytes of data in a matter of minutes, and sometimes of acceptable quality. We consider several cases including StackOverflow questions tagging with a training set of several gigabytes.</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic9-teaser.jpg" /></div>

<p>Here we discuss various approaches to work with time series: what data preparation is necessary, how to get short-term and long-term predictions. We walk through various types of time series models, from simple moving average to gradient boosting. We also take a look at the ways to search for anomalies in time series and discuss the pros and cons of these methods.</p>

<h4 id="week-10-gradient-boosting">Week 10. Gradient Boosting</h4>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/20221001-mlcourseai-roadmap/topic10-teaser.jpeg" /></div>

<p>Gradient boosting is one of the most prominent Machine Learning algorithms, it founds a lot of industrial applications. For instance, the Yandex search engine is a big and complex system with gradient boosting (MatrixNet) somewhere deep inside. Many recommender systems are also built on boosting. It is a very versatile approach applicable to classification, regression, and ranking. Therefore, here we cover both theoretical basics of gradient boosting and specifics of most wide-spread implementations – Xgboost, LightGBM, and Catboost.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read the <a href="https://mlcourse.ai/articles/topic10-boosting/">article</a> (same in a form of a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-10-gradient-boosting">Kaggle Notebook</a>)</li>

Start analyzing data and building features to improve your solution. Try to improve the best publicly shared solution by at least 0.5%. But still, <strong>please do not share high-performing solutions</strong>, it ruins the competitive spirit.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ods_mlcourse">Bonus Assignment</a>:</strong> here we go through the math and implement the general gradient boosting algorithm from scratch. The same class will implement a binary classifier that minimizes the logistic loss function and two regressors that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) and the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE). This way, we will see that we can optimize arbitrary differentiable functions using gradient boosting and how this technique adapts to different contexts.
