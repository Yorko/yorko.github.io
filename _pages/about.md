I am an applied Machine Learning Scientist. Born in Russia, made a world around living 4 years in Israel and 1.5 years in Canada. Then back to Russia. Currently residing in the Netherlands.

In the Data Science community, I'm known for leading open Machine Learning course [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai). I graduated from MIPT â€“ Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and got a Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from the Federal Research Center for Computer Science and Control, Russian Academy of Science (for Russians: it's the Vorontsov, D'yakonov & Co. group). As for industry, I worked for VK.com (Russian IT-giant, formerly known as Mail.Ru Group), KPN (telco operator in the Netherlands) and Elsevier. See the [CV](cv) page for more on this. 

I'm married and have a small daughter.

### About this blog

This blog is about machine learning, mathematics, quantum computation, career development, programming, soft skills, popular science and anything else that I find exciting and (hopefully) can interestingly describe. My long-lasting nickname is Yorko (some African variation of the name Yury). And often times, something new is happening in my life. Hence, I'm titling the blog **New Yorko Times**. From time to time, I'd write in my native language Russian as well.
